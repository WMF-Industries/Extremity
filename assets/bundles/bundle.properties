  \nTo view the tutorial, use /extremity

# First boot welcome message of the mod - split into a few parts cause it really is long
extremity-info = [accent]Welcome to Extremity![]\
  \n\nThis mod attempts to make Mindustry [scarlet]harder[] without modifying or adding any content, instead, it runs custom behavior code on various events.\
  \n\nPlease note that [accent]Extremity[] is a bit on the heavier side of mods, therefore a decent device is recommended in order to play.\
  \nWeak devices may experience performance issues, bugs or even crashes!\
  \n\nHead over to the settings in order to set [accent]Extremity[] up, good luck!

# Clientside tutorial stuff
extremity-tutorial1-title = Welcome!
extremity-tutorial1 = [accent]Welcome to Extremity's Tutorial[]\
  \nWe'll shortly cover all the things added by Extremity on every level of difficulty\
  \n\nIf a difficulty level has no tutorial entries, it doesn't add any new mechanics, only scales them up!
extremity-tutorial2-title = [yellow]Mediocrity[]
extremity-tutorial2 = Being the lowest difficulty level, [yellow]Mediocrity[] introduces quite a few new mechanics\
  \n\nDying enemy units spawn other units according to the provided unitdex\
  \nWeathers affect buildings:\
  \nSandstorms slow down conveyors\
  \nSnow slows down every building\
  \nRain damages buildings over time unless they're under \uF898Force Projectors
extremity-tutorial3-title = [orange]Fatality[]
extremity-tutorial3 = [orange]Fatality[] raises the bar by scaling up the previous mechanics & adding a few new ones\
  \n\nEnemy units now get the \uF678Fast status effect\
  \nAlly units get \uF7A6Corroded if \uF7B2Wet\
  \nTurrets require coolant to operate, without it, they will explode after a few shots\
  \nBuildings near the drop zone get damaged each wave
extremity-tutorial4-title = [scarlet]True Extremity[]
extremity-tutorial4 = As the hardest "fair" difficulty level, [scarlet]True Extremity[] brings a real challenge\
  \n\nAlly units \uF7B3Slow down\
  \nEnemy \uF7A9Guradians give \uF7AAShielded to all nearby enemies upon death\
  \nThe enemy can attack random captured sectors, even ones without a base nearby
extremity-tutorial5-title = [#c40004]High Mediocrity[]
extremity-tutorial5 = Entering [scarlet]Beyond Mode[], [#c40004]High Mediocrity[] brings victory chances quite low, scaling stuff up a lot\
  \n\nAlly bullets have lifetime damage scaling, making them weak at first\n\uF898Force Projectors no longer protect against rain\
  \n[scarlet]Upon losing a sector, the entire campaign of the current planet gets reset
extremity-tutorial6-title = [#cf0078]Prime Fatality[]
extremity-tutorial6 = [#cf0078]Prime Fatality[] introduces the final, most cruel mechanic\
  \n\nLosing a single core causes every other core to explode
extremity-tutorial7-title = The End
extremity-tutorial7 = [accent]Congrats![]\
  \nYou've reached the end of the tutorial, well done!\
  \nHope this brief content introduction was clear enough\
  \n\n[lightgray]Remember that the mod allows you to customize certain factors, such as the unitdexes![]\
  \n\nEnjoy the mod!

setting.extremity-beyond.name = Beyond Extreme
setting.extremity-beyond.description = Enables the Extremity Beyond mode, greatly increasing the difficulty\
  \n[scarlet]!! This setting cannot be changed afterwards, however it'll reset upon losing a game !!
setting.extremity-beyond.confirm = [scarlet]Caution[], losing a campaign sector while Extremity Beyond is enabled will cause the entire campaign progress on that planet to be [scarlet]reset[]\
  \n\n[accent]If you care about your save a lot, export a backup from within the game's settings or cancel the change to Beyond mode.[]\
  \n\n[lightgray]Beyond Mode as well as other difficulty related settings automatically reset to default values upon losing any game!

  \n\n[accent]If you care about your save a lot, export a backup from within the game's settings or disable the setting![]\
  \n\n[scarlet]Be aware that this option disregards the difficulty level, therefore it works even if the mod's set to vanilla.
setting.extremity-pvp.name = Run on PvP
setting.extremity-pvp.description = If enabled, the mod will run even if hosting PvP\
  \nPlease note that this setting makes PvP games much more chaotic, and possibly unfair!

  \nPlease note that Unitdex Editor is currently highly experimental\
  \nChanging this setting may cause minor ui clipping issues
